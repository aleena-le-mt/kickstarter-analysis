# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to visualize how different campaigns perform based on their funding goals and launch dates.
### Background
A play entitled "Fever" that Louise is a part of came very close to its fundraising goal in a short time span. Do to that fact, she wants to know how the other different campaigns performed in regard to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

According to this marked line chart showing the theater outcomes based on launch date, the most amount of successful and failed campaigns happened in May, although, there are more successful outcomes within that month compared to failed. The number of canceled campaigns has been under 10 every month in all years with most of it happening in January. To sum it all up, most of the successful and failed campaigns happened in May and most of the canceled campaigns happened in the beginning of most years.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

This is a line chart with a general visual of the campaign outcomes depending on the funding goals of the campaigns in percentages. It is shown above that when there is high percentage of success, the percentage of failed campaigns would be low and vice versa. For the canceled ones however, it is always at 0%. With a goal between 45000 to 49999, the percentage of success would be at 100% and 0% for failed campaigns. The main idea of all this is that the amount of successful and failed campaigns is always opposite of each other.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Something that I had a bit of trouble on was figuring out how to filter the specific Kickstarter data in order to put it into the "Outcomes Based on Goals" table accurately because it is not a pivot table. I had to look at the hint to figure this one out and found that I must make sure that I add in all of the columns of what I want to be in my data into the function for it to be accurate. The hint also reminded me to apply the F4 key to my data making things more efficient for me when because all I need to do is copy and paste for the next set of data without worrying if I am using the right data or not. By then, I was able to create the chart for it.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

 The max number of successful campaigns happen in May and that the number of canceled campaigns is never higher than 10.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

 The percentage results of successful outcomes are always opposite of failed campaigns and there is a 0% chance of campaigns getting cancelled no matter what funding goal the campaigns may have.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

 Some limitations can of this dataset can be the location in which these results are taken within each country because people who live in certain places may have different preferences than people from other places. Another limitation can be how wealthy people are in different areas within a country.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

 We can create a table and line graph about theater outcomes based on the number of days that these campaigns have to keep up with. Another thing that we can possibly do is make a line graph to see which subcategory has the most amount of success.
